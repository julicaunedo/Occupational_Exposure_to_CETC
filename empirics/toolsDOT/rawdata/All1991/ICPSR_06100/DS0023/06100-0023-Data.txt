MESSAGE FROM THE SECRETARY                                                      
                                                                                
 Since its inception, the Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT) has provided  
basic occupational information to many and varied users in both public and      
private sectors of the United States economy. This revised Fourth Edition of    
the DOT appears at a time when there is growing recognition of the need for     
lifetime learning, when rapid technological change is making the jobs of        
current workers more complex than they were even a few years ago, and when      
timely and accurate labor market information is an increasingly important       
component of personal and corporate decision-making.                            
                                                                                
 Publication of this document reaffirms in the clearest way the Department's    
continuing commitment to assist jobseekers, employers, educational and          
training institutions, researchers, and other interested parties with the most  
current and accurate occupational information possible. I hope that             
publication of this revised Fourth Edition will constitute a public service as  
timely and valuable as was publication of its predecessor volumes.              
                                                                                
LYNN MARTIN                                                                     
Secretary of Labor
