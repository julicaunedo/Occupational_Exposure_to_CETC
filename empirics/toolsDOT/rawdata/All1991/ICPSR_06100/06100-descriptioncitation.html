		        		<h2>Project Description:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> First published in 1939, the Dictionary of Occupational 
 Titles (DOT) groups jobs based on their similarities and defines the 
 structure and content of all listed occupations. The Revised Fourth 
 Edition is the result of ten years of research and verification by job 
 analysts across the nation. Each occupational definition systematically 
 presents the following seven basic parts: an occupational code number, 
 a title, an industry designation, alternate titles, a body of text 
 including a lead statement, task statements, glossary words, and 
 reference titles, undefined related titles, and a definition trailer. 
 The occupational code number and the definition trailer provide data 
 about a particular job's skill requirements, specific vocational 
training requirements, and year last reviewed by an occupation analyst.</span></p>
