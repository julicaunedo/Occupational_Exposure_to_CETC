Selects and inserts screen tints in film flat, using knowledge of dot percentages required to obtain specific colors. Cuts out masks, using razor blade, artist's knife, or mask cutting tool, and arranges negatives in order, to prepare for contact printing, plate exposure, or proof making. Aligns multiple negatives and masks over unexposed film in vacuum frame and activates light source to make negatives or positives for final film of each color. Determines or approves plans and page sequences to lay out job for specific printing press. Pieces together and aligns negatives or positives on masking sheet or transparent plastic sheet, applying knowledge acquired from experience in film assembly to assure register and fit with all units of color, to assemble film flat. Inverts assembled film flat on table and cuts windows behind image areas of negatives or positives, using razor blade or artist's knife, to allow exposure to plate or film. Routes completed negative or positive flat to proofing area for preparation of positive or negative proof. Examines proof returned by customer and makes corrections or remakes film to meet customer's specifications.
