0015653|8|85|CLERICAL        |clerical        |CLERICAL AND KINDRED OCCUPATIONS: This designation includes the following types of occupations that are common to a number of industries: (1) those occupations whose clerical duties take up a majority of the worker's time; (2) those occupations whose clerical duties take up a minority of the worker's time, but for which the major requirement is the ability to perform the clerical duties; (3) those occupations whose duties, although nonclerical, are dependent on and intimately connected with definite clerical jobs, and for which the promotional sequence usually is to positions of a strictly clerical character; and (4) white collar occupations that are not strictly clerical in character but that are more closely associated with truly clerical workers than with occupations in other occupational groups. Clerical duties in this classification are considered to be: (1) duties related to general office work, such as bookkeeping, taking and transcribing dictation, typing, auditing, and keeping records (often referred to as pencil work or paper work); and (2) duties pertaining to the operation of various office machines, such as adding machines, calculating machines, and duplicating machines. Occupations of a clerical nature that are peculiar to individual industries are not covered by this designation, but are included with the specific industry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
