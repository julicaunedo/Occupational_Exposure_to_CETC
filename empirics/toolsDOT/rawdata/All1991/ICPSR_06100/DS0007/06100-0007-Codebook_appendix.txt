APPENDIX E                                                                      
                                                                                
OCCUPATIONAL CODE REQUESTS                                                      
                                                                                
 Users of the revised fourth edition DOT may be unable to locate a specific job 
title, code, or definition in the DOT or the specific information for a         
definition in the DOT may appear to be incorrect.  This situation could occur   
for several reasons including:                                                  
                                                                                
1. The job title the user seeks is new or was created as the result of recent   
   technological changes or labor force pressures.                              
                                                                                
2. The user seeks job information that may be more specific or may be organized 
   differently than the information provided in the composite revised DOT       
   definition.                                                                  
                                                                                
3. The user may not be completely familiar with the taxonomic structure of the  
   revised DOT.                                                                 
                                                                                
4. Job analysts may have missed occupational information due to technological   
   advances or changes in that industry.                                        
                                                                                
5. The job title may not have enough workers performing the work to facilitate  
   data collection.                                                             
                                                                                
 The Occupational Code Request (Form ETA-741) was developed by the OA program   
to allow users of the revised DOT a means to provide input to, or obtain from   
USES OA Field Centers, information on job titles or occupational definitions    
they cannot find in the DOT. Users who have searched the DOT for needed         
information and have been unsuccessful should contact the nearest Job Service   
office for assistance in locating an appropriate DOT classification for the job 
in question.  If the Job Service office cannot supply the needed occupational   
information, the DOT user should submit a typed Occupational Code Request (OCR) 
form to the appropriate OA Field Center.  A copy of the OCR showing action      
taken by the OAFC will be returned to the user in a timely manner.              
                                                                                
 If it is not convenient to seek the help of the local Job Service office, you  
may send your requests for a DOT title and code directly to an Occupational     
Analysis Field Center. In your correspondence, please include the OCR so that   
the request can be processed correctly. DOT users who find incorrect or         
inaccurate occupational information in the DOT may contact the nearest          
Occupational Analysis Field Center directly.                                    
                                                                                
 The OCR procedure, which has been set up to provide supplementary occupational 
information to users, serves as an additional method of securing job            
information for subsequent publications. Classifications established as a       
result of an OCR are usable on an interim basis until the job is studied by an  
occupational analyst and a definition is published in the DOT.                  
                                                                                
 Blank copies of Form ETA-741 may be obtained from the nearest Job Service      
office or Occupational Analysis Field Center.
