0009636|7        |1|77|BENCHWORK OCCUPATIONS                                   |This category includes occupations concerned with the use of body members, handtools, and bench machines to fit, grind, carve, mold, paint, sew, assemble, inspect, repair, and similarly work relatively small objects and materials, such as jewelry, phonographs, light bulbs, musical instruments, tires, footwear, pottery, and garments. The work is usually performed at a set position in a mill, plant, or shop, at a bench, worktable, or conveyor. At the more complex levels, workers frequently read blueprints, follow patterns, use a variety of handtools, and assume responsibility for meeting standards. Workers at the less complex levels are required to follow standardized procedures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
0012544|8        |1|77|STRUCTURAL WORK OCCUPATIONS                             |This category includes occupations concerned with fabricating, erecting, installing, paving, painting, repairing, and similarly working structures or structural parts, such as bridges, buildings, roads, transportation equipment frames and structures, cables, girders, plates, and frames. The work generally occurs outside a factory or shop environment, except for factory production line occupations concerned with fabricating, installing, erecting, or repairing structures. Tools used are handtools or portable power tools, and such materials as wood, metal, concrete, glass, and clay are involved. Stationary machines are frequently used in structural work occupations, but the worker's relationship to machines is usually secondary in importance as compared to use of handtools and portable power tools. Workers are frequently required to have a knowledge of the materials with which they work, e.g., stresses, strains, durability, and resistance to weather.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
