Overcoiling is the act of bending outer coil.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

0016952|7|77|TRUING II                             |Technique used for correcting errors in timepiece balance wheels and hairsprings. Balance wheel truing is accomplished by bending the wheel rim until it lies in a single plane and is concentric with and perpendicular to the staff axis. Hairspring errors are either in the round (coils are not perfectly concentric with collet) or in the flat (coils are not in same plane as collet). Hairsprings are trued by bending coil to correct faulty colleting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
